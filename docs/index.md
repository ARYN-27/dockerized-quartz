# Dockerized Quartz

[Quartz (v4)](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) is a lightweight static site generator that helps you host your digital garden. This project provides automated dockerized solution to build and serve Quartz sites with minimal configuration.

## Features

- **Minimal Configuration**: Simply plug in your existing Obsidian Vault as read-only docker bind volume.

- **Automated Builds**: Quartz will rebuild every time after set delay as files in your docker voulume change.

- **Webhook Trigger**: Additional way of triggering Quartz build by sending POST request to secret URL.

- **Notifications**: Notifications on build start, success or fail. 

- **Default or Custom Quartz Repository**: If none present, container will clone git repo on startup, [the Quartz repo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz). This can be used to quickly test and evaluate stuff.

- **Support for Private Repositories**: If you want to hide your Quartz config. 

- **NGINX Web Server**: Served with NGINX, basic configuration by default, can be extended by mounting docker volume and editing `nginx.conf`
